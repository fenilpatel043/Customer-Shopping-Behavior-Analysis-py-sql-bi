Data-driven analysis of customer shopping patterns using Python, MySQL, and Power BI — uncovering insights into spending behavior, customer segments, and product performance to support smarter business decisions.

Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
 Project Overview

This project explores customer shopping behavior using real transactional data from 3,900 purchases.
It aims to understand who buys what, when, and why, turning raw data into actionable business insights.
The analysis was performed using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.

 Dataset Summary

Rows: 3,900

Columns: 18

Key Fields: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status, Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Discount Applied, Review Rating, Shipping Type

Missing Data: 37 values in Review Rating (handled with median imputation)

 Step 1: Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)

Data was prepared using Python for:

Handling missing values

Standardizing column names

Creating new features like age_group and purchase_frequency

Connecting the cleaned dataset to MySQL for structured analysis

 Step 2: SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Key analytical insights were generated using MySQL, including:

Revenue by gender and subscription status

High-spending discount users

Top-rated products

Shipping type comparison

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

Age group revenue distribution

 Step 3: Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to visualize:

Revenue trends by demographics

Product category performance

Subscription vs. non-subscription behavior

Discount vs. non-discount purchases

Top-rated and most purchased products

 Key Business Insights

Subscribers spend more and shop more frequently

Female shoppers slightly outspend males on average

Express shipping users often make higher-value purchases

Top-rated products drive repeat buyers

Discount-heavy categories need margin optimization
